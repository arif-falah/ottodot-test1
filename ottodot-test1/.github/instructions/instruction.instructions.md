Tailwind CSS, and the Supabase client.
● AI Integration: Use a generative AI (e.g., Google's Gemini) for two tasks:
○ To generate a math word problem. The AI must return a JSON object with
problem_text and the final_answer (the correct numerical solution).
○ To generate personalized feedback based on the user's submission.
● Database: Use a free Supabase project.
○ Create two tables: math_problem_sessions and math_problem_submissions.
The required schema is provided in the starter kit.
○ All generated problems and user submissions must be persisted in these
tables.
● Frontend: A clean, mobile-responsive interface built using Tailwind CSS.
